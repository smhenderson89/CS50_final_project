Final Project for CS50x-2020

This is my final project for CS50x, year 2020. 

The goal of this project is to create a website that lists your Florida-Man Horoscope. To achieve this, I have created a web scraper for google results for 
"Florida Man + Month + Date" of a user's Month and Date of birth. From there, I saved the information into a SQL database and retrive the results onto a website
the user can navigate to look at their Florida Man Horoscope.
